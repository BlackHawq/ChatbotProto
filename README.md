A.L.P.A.C.A chatbot ReadME
This project is the prototype for a chatbot that attempts to follow the structure described by the flowchart below
![Chatbot Design logic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab96a8e7-ca6b-42ca-a667-ef839c12d1a9)

Things I would implement given more time:
I wanted to research and implement an NLP engine instead of the simpler designed flowchart logic I have
Making more basic conversations instead of only business
Add allocation for multiple orders
Adding Proper address handling, supporting large names and better accomodations for invalid answers
Being able to backtrack properly instead of looping
